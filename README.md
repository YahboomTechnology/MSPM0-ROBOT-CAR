# Introduction
Yahboom MSPM0 smart robot car is a high-performance entry-level smart car platform based on MSPM0G3507 main control chip, designed specifically for electronic engineering, embedded learning, and innovative experiments. It integrates multiple functional modules such as motor drive, line tracking, obstacle avoidance, infrared remote control, light-seek and OLED display, helping users systematically learn sensor principles and motion control algorithms. The car adopts modular design, compatible with various sensor expansion interfaces. Users can connect external BT module, servo PTZ, vision recognition module, voice interaction module, etc., to achieve richer intelligent control and interactive applications. Meanwhile, its open hardware architecture and abundant software examples make it an ideal choice for STEM education, university course experiments, embedded teaching, and maker project development.

# Features
* Multiple configurations are available: Basic version, advanced version, K210 superior version, and K230 superior version. The shipping list may vary depending on the version; please purchase according to your needs.

* High-Performance, Low-Power Main Control Chip: Utilizes the original TI MSPM0G3507 main control chip, integrating high performance and lower power consumption for stable operation and excellent real-time response.

* Modular Integrated Design, Multi-functional smart car: On board multiple commonly used sensor modules (ultrasonic, infrared remote control, line tracking, photosensitive sensor, etc.) support various functions such as line tracking, obstacle avoidance, speed measurement, remote control, and light detection, allowing users to experience intelligent control.

*  Multiple Interface Expansion, Supporting Advanced Development: Provides abundant expansion interfaces such as GPIO, I2C, and UART, allowing connection to external BT module, vision module, voice module, servo PTZ, etc., to achieve advanced functions such as visual recognition, voice interaction, and autonomous driving.

* Comprehensive Teaching Materials, Easy To Learn: Provides complete 3D model file, chip development manual, schematics, program source codes, and detailed tutorials, effectively lowering the learning threshold.
